        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>This kebab sandwich is my version of Turkish kebabs, which I made 'off the cuff' after searching unsuccessfully for a recipe online.</p>

            
            <p>The original sandwiches are made from meat pressed into a loaf and grilled on a rotating spit.</p>
